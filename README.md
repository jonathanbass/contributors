Simple full-stack app with React front-end and .NET 6 back-end using mediator pattern.

To run the API you will require GitHub credentials in `appsettings.json`. "Username" is your GitHub username and "Password" is a generated [fine-grained personal access token.](https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/)

To run the client you will need to navigate to the /client directory and run `npm run start`.
